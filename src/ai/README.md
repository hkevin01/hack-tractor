# AI and Machine Learning

This directory contains AI and machine learning models for the Hack Tractor project.

## Purpose

- Optimize equipment operation based on collected data
- Predict maintenance needs to reduce downtime
- Enable semi-autonomous operation where appropriate
- Integrate with environmental and crop data for smart farming

## Models

- Equipment optimization models
- Predictive maintenance algorithms
- Pattern recognition for field operations
- Integration with weather and soil data

## Data Requirements

Models in this directory rely on data collected from equipment interfaces and external sources. See the `data/` directory for sample datasets and collection methodologies.

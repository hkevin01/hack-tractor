# Computer Vision

This directory contains computer vision modules using OpenCV for the Hack Tractor project.

## Components

- `equipment_detection/` - Detection of equipment parts and status
- `field_analysis/` - Analysis of field conditions from visual data
- `obstacle_detection/` - Detection of obstacles for autonomous operation

## Implementation Notes

- OpenCV is used as the primary computer vision library
- Models are designed to work with low-cost cameras
- Consider edge deployment constraints

# Equipment Interface

This directory contains libraries and utilities for interfacing with various agricultural equipment.

## Purpose

- Establish communication with farm equipment via CAN bus, OBD-II, or other protocols
- Decode proprietary data formats
- Enable control and monitoring of equipment functions
- Provide a standardized API for the AI and dashboard components

## Supported Equipment

- Generic CAN bus interfaces
- OBD-II compatible tractors and equipment
- [Additional equipment types to be added during hackathon]

## Implementation Notes

The interfaces prioritize safe operation while enabling farmers to access additional functionality.
